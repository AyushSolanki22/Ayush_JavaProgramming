// A scope is a variable's use limitation. In Java, there are three types of scopes: (dayra)
//Method scope  : variables declared within a method are only accessible within that whole method/function.

//Block scope : variables declared within a block of code (enclosed in curly braces {}) are only accessible within that block.

//Class scope --> accesss modifiers --> public/private/protected; (detailed in OOPs)
