//Recursion -- iterations, functions,,,, main use in trees, graphs, dp(dynamic programming)
//Sometimes, for some programmes, recursion is better (like trees), for other, iteration is better.

//Recursion - when a function call itself on repetition (loop)
//example: math -- factorial

//It is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
//2 directions: top to down(towards base case), down to top (combining solutions)
// 1. Base case, 2. work, 3. inner call
