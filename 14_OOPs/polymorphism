Polymorphism --- many forms

--Compile Time Polymorphism ^(static)
* Method Overloading ((multiple functions with same name but different parameters -like in constructors with different parameters))

--Run Time Polymorphism  ^(dynamic - when user oneself get to know polymorphism, not at compile time)
* Method overriding  ((parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different definition --- whenever overriding is done then the function is called by the object of the object's ,class whichever it is , either parent or derived))
